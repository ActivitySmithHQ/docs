## Welcome to ActivitySmith

[ActivitySmith](https://activitysmith.com) is API service that lets you trigger and update Live Activities and send push notifications directly from your own infrastructure. Pair your iOS device(s), authenticate with an API key, and send real-time alerts from any backend, cron, agent, or automation. Without building or maintaining your own iOS app or dealing directly with APNs.

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API. You can download the iOS app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6752254835).

## Push Notifications

To send a push notification, use the `push-notification` endpoint. It takes the title and message as parameters and sends a push notification to all of your paired devices.

<img className="image" src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/printkit/notification.png" alt="Push Notification" />

```bash
curl -X POST https://activitysmith.com/api/push-notification \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Build Failed 🚨",
    "message": "CI pipeline failed on main branch"
  }'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "devices_notified": 3,
  "users_notified": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Live Activities

### /start endpoint

To start a Live Activity, use the `live-activity/start` endpoint. It takes a `content_state` payload and starts a Live Activity on your lock screen or dynamic island. For a segmented progress activity, include `title`, `current_step`, `type`, and `number_of_steps`.

<img className="image" src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/printkit/live-activity-start.png" alt="Live Activity Start" />

```bash

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content_state": {
      "title": "ActivitySmith API Deployment",
      "subtitle": "start",
      "number_of_steps": 4,
      "current_step": 1,
      "type": "segmented_progress",
      "color": "yellow"
    }
  }'
```

### Response

It returns a `activity_id` that you can use to update or end the Live Activity.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "activity_id": "pLAr-Hnq9ZFW4sxlk43Lhbuok4GLh7UW",
  "devices_notified": 2,

  "timestamp": "2026-01-28T09:57:22.929Z"
}
```

### /update endpoint

To update the Live Activity, call `live-activity/update` with the `activity_id` and a `content_state` payload (minimum: `title`, `current_step`).
