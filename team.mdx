## Managing Team Members

The **Members** page is where team owners manage access for the whole workspace.

You can:

- Invite one or many people at once
- See active users and their role
- Track pending invitations and expiration dates
- Remove members when they no longer need access

## Roles

ActivitySmith currently supports two team roles:

| Role     | Access                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`  | Full access, including inviting and removing members          |
| `member` | Standard workspace access without team management permissions |

## Invite Team Members

Only team owners can invite new members.

1. Open your ActivitySmith dashboard.
2. Go to **Members** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Invite members**.
4. Enter one or more email addresses in the invite modal.
5. Separate multiple emails with commas or new lines.
6. Click **Send Invites**.

Newly invited users appear in the **Invited users** table with:

- `pending` status until accepted
- Invite date (`Invited`)
- Expiration date (`Expires`)

Members are added to **Active users** only after they accept the invite.

## Remove a Member

Only team owners can remove members.

1. Open **Members**.
2. Find the user in **Active users**.
3. Click **Remove** in the **Actions** column.
4. Confirm the removal.

The removed member loses team access immediately.
