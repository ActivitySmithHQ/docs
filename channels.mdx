description: "Use channels to target specific users and devices."

Channels let you target specific groups of recipients instead of sending to everyone in an account.

Common use case:

- Different teams should receive different notifications (for example, `marketing`, `developers`, `devops`, `sre`).

Channels are flexible:

- You can assign users, devices, or both to a channel.
- You can choose channels per request using `target.channels`.
- You can keep some API keys broad and scope other API keys to specific channels.

## How Targeting Works

Use channel slugs in `target.channels`:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "channels": ["ios-beta", "ops"]
  }
}
```

- If `target` is omitted and API key scope is `all`, delivery goes to all recipients in the account.
- If `target` is omitted and API key scope is `channels`, delivery goes to channels assigned to that API key.
- If `target.channels` is provided, only those channel slugs are targeted.

## Push Notifications

```json
{
  "title": "New subscription 💸",
  "message": "Customer upgraded to Pro plan",
  "target": {
    "channels": ["ios-beta", "ops"]
  }
}
```

## Live Activities

```json
{
  "content_state": {
    "title": "Nightly database backup",
    "number_of_steps": 3,
    "current_step": 1,
    "type": "segmented_progress"
  },
  "target": {
    "channels": ["ios-beta", "ops"]
  }
}
```
