## Base URL

All requests contain the following base URL:

```bash
https://activitysmith.com/api/
```

## Authentication

For authentication, it's required to include an Authorization header. The header should contain `Bearer ask_123456789`, where `ask_123456789` represents your API Key.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer ask_123456789
```

## Response codes

ActivitySmith employs conventional HTTP status codes to signify the outcome of your requests.

Typically, 2xx HTTP status codes denote success, 4xx codes represent failures related to the user, and 5xx codes signal infrastructure problems.

| Status | Description                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 200    | Request was successful.                      |
| 400    | Verify the correctness of the parameters.    |
| 401    | The API key is invalid or was not provided.  |
| 404    | The requested resource could not be located. |
| 429    | The rate limit has been surpassed.           |
| 5xx    | Signifies a server error with ActivitySmith. |

Refer to the Error Codes section for a detailed explanation of all potential API errors.

## Channels

Channels let you target specific subsets of recipients instead of broadcasting to everyone in an account.

- Use channels when teams, environments, or workflows need separate delivery groups.
- Keep API keys broad or channel-scoped depending on how strict you want targeting to be.

Read the full [channels guide](/channels).

## Rate limit

The ActivitySmith API has a [rate limit](/rate-limits) to ensure the stability and reliability of the service. The rate limit is applied to all endpoints and is based on the number of requests made within a specific time frame.

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a 429 response code.
